## CodeBox

This project is built using JavaScript and OpenAI API, with more than a dozen programming languages under its belt. CodeBox is now capable of understanding straightforward user requests in natural language and carrying them out on the user's behalf. This makes it possible to create a natural language interface for already-existing apps.
